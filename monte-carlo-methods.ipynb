    "The **Monte Carlo** methods of evaluating conditional mean for option pricing is nearly always the method of choice for high-dimensional problems. It is also easy to apply to problems with non-Markovian dynamics as well as strong path-dependency in the payout, which PDE or finite-difference method cannot handle. However, it is not straightforward to apply Monte Carlo on backward induction problem, such as American or Bermudan option pricing.\n",
